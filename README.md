# Snake3D
In Snake3D you can play snake on the surface of a 3d-cube.

### Features
→ two gamemodes:
1. normal(like the old snake, but on a cube)
2. hard(like normal + every time you eat a radom border appears somewhere on the cube, so be careful)

→ two levels

→ no external libraries needed(Snake3D has already everything on board it needs.)

### How to build
1. Download the source code here on github.
2. Extract the .zip file.
3. Compile the content of src. This can be done with `javac *.java` in the terminal **OR** by importing the code to any IDE you want and compile it from there.
4. Press run in your IDE **OR** type `java main` in your terminal
5. Have fun playing. You can change game mode/level with `g`, start the game with `space`. Ingame you can turn the cube with `wasd` and move the snake with `←` and `→`

### Contribution
If you find something you can make better, feel free to make a pull request(Thank you in advance). I would like it if you would try to roughly follow the syntax and commentation density I used in the code, but I won't reject your PR if you don't.
If you want to support me, but don't know what to make better in my code, there are some comments containing a `TODO` note.
